      <h2 class="w3-center">War on Terror</h2><br>
      
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">We find the world-shattering 9/11 terrorist attacks to be a pivotal moment in the history of terrorist attacks. 19 Al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four civilian airliners and crashed them into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon adjacent to Washington, DC. The terrorist attacks killed 2,977 people, the vast majority of whom were civilians. This was followed by the global War on Terror led by the United States, together with NATO allies, which continues to this day. Despite the successes of the war on terror, there are questions about the legitimacy and rationality of the operation. One of the most important aspects is the terrorist attacks that the war has brought to the region.</p>
          
          
          
 
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">In the case of Afghanistan, the map on the left shows the terrorist attacks in the country from 1970 to 2020. The lighter map shows terrorist attacks in Afghanistan before the start of the Afghan war by US forces in 2001, and the darker map shows terrorist attacks after the start of the war in 2001, which we can find a significant increase in terrorist attacks.</p>

      <h2 class="w3-center">The Levant</h2><br>
      
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">The Levant has been a hotspot for terrorist attacks since the middle of the last century, and the 1948 UN General Assembly resolution 181, which partitioned the Palestinian Mandate, followed by five Middle East wars between Israel and Arab countries in the next three decades, the Iran-Iraq War, the Gulf War, the Iraqi War in the new century, the Syrian Civil War, etc., have destroyed the region's once splendid culture and prosperous economy, turning the city into ruins.</p>
          
           
            <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">In 2003 the United States launched a war against the Baathist government of Iraq on the grounds that it possessed weapons of mass destruction. US troops soon entered Baghdad and Saddam was soon tried by the new Iraqi government, but the war did not end with it and the lack of order provided the perfect opportunity for the rise of the terrorist group Islamic State a few years later. The map on the right shows terrorist attacks in the Levant before and after 2003, which had risen significantly with the start of the war in Iraq.</p>

            <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">We can see a rapid rise in the number of global terrorist attacks after 2003 and reaching a peak in 2014, followed by a gradual decline, but still at a high level in 2020.</p>
          



        </div>

    <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">In 2010 the Arab Spring erupted in Arab countries, with the overthrow of the governments of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen and the outbreak of violent conflict in Syria, followed by a civil war that continues to this day. Fierce fighting between government forces and anti-government forces led to a loss of order, and the prolonged war led to the rapid rise of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. The lack of order led to a rapid rise in the number of terrorist attacks during this time, which reached a peak in 2014. As countries unite in military strikes against the Islamic State, the Islamic State gradually loses control of its territory and loses all in 2019.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">We therefore believe that order is a key factor in reducing the occurrence of terrorist attacks, and from the <a href="index.html" class="w3-tag w3-light-grey">Global Terrorist Attacks Map</a>we can see that the vast majority of terrorist attacks occur in countries at war during times of war, such as the lost decade in Peru (1980s), the civil war in Yemen (2014-present), the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria (2009-present), etc. A stable social environment prevents the breeding of terrorism, so the most effective counter-terrorism is to help establish a functioning local social order.</p>
